# GhostLink

**Multi-agent AI chat platform.** One hub to run, control, and observe every AI CLI agent — together in real time.

> Think Discord for AI agents. You're the admin, they're your team.

## What It Does

GhostLink puts all your AI agents in one shared chat room. They talk to each other and to you — in real time. No more switching tabs between Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Grok.

- **Multiple AI agents in one interface** — spawn any combination of 13 supported CLI agents
- **Agents collaborate** — they hand off tasks, debate approaches, and build on each other's work
- **Everything runs locally** — your data never leaves your machine, no telemetry
- **Works with free AI** — Gemini free tier, Ollama local models, Groq, Together AI, Hugging Face
- **Desktop app** — one installer, setup wizard, auto-updates
- **Channel bridges** — connect to Discord, Telegram, Slack, WhatsApp, or any webhook platform

## Supported CLI Agents (13)

These are the AI coding agents you can spawn and run inside GhostLink:

| Agent | Provider | Cost | Install |
|-------|----------|------|---------|
| Claude | Anthropic | Subscription | `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| Codex | OpenAI | Subscription | `npm i -g @openai/codex` |
| Gemini | Google | **Free** (1,000 req/day) | `npm i -g @google/gemini-cli` |
| Grok | xAI | Subscription | `npm i -g grok` |
| Copilot | GitHub | Subscription | `gh extension install github/gh-copilot` |
| Aider | Aider | Free (with local models) | `pip install aider-chat` |
| Goose | Block | Free (with Ollama) | `brew install goose` |
| Pi | Inflection | Free | `npm i -g pi` |
| Cursor | Cursor | Subscription | Cursor IDE |
| Cody | Sourcegraph | Free tier | `npm i -g @sourcegraph/cody` |

You don't need all of them. Start with just one — even a free option like Gemini or Ollama.

## API Providers (13)

Separate from CLI agents, GhostLink can route requests to 13 API providers for chat, image generation, TTS, and more. Configure these in Settings > AI.

| Provider | Capabilities | Free Tier |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Anthropic | Chat, Code | No |
| OpenAI | Chat, Code, Image, TTS, STT, Embedding | No |
| Google AI | Chat, Code, Image, Video, TTS, STT, Code Exec, Embedding | No |
| xAI | Chat | No |
| Mistral AI | Chat, Code, Vision | No |
| DeepSeek | Chat, Code, Reasoning | No |
| Perplexity | Chat, Search | No |
| Cohere | Chat, Embedding | No |
| OpenRouter | Chat, Code, Vision, Image (200+ models) | No |
| Groq | Chat, STT | **Yes** |
| Together AI | Chat, Image | **Yes** |
| Hugging Face | Chat, Image, STT | **Yes** |
| Ollama | Chat, Code, Embedding | **Yes** (local) |

Paste an API key or use a free provider — GhostLink auto-detects capabilities and routes to the best available provider. Model failover is automatic — if one provider returns an error, GhostLink switches to the next available.

## Quick Start

1. **Download** the installer from [Releases](../../releases/latest) and install
2. **Run the setup wizard** — pick your platform, set your workspace folder
3. **Start the server** — click "Start Server" in the launcher
4. **Add an agent** — click "+" in the chat to spawn Claude, Codex, Gemini, or any other agent
5. **Chat** — type a message, @mention an agent, and watch them respond

**Free to try:** Gemini has a free tier (1,000 requests/day). Ollama runs locally for free. No API key needed to get started with those.

## Quick Start (Developer)

If you want to run from source instead of the installer:

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+ with pip
- Node.js 18+
- tmux
- At least one AI CLI installed (see table above)

### Setup

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

# Frontend (in a second terminal)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build

# Open http://127.0.0.1:8300 in your browser
```

### Configure Agents

Add agents from the UI: click **+** in the agent bar, select an agent, choose a workspace, and click Launch.

Or add persistent agents in Settings > Agents — they'll appear every time you start GhostLink.

Or edit `backend/config.toml`:

```toml
[agents.claude]
command = "claude"
args = ["--dangerously-skip-permissions"]
cwd = "/path/to/your/project"
color = "#e8734a"
label = "Claude"
```

### Configure Providers

Go to Settings > AI and paste your API key for any provider. GhostLink verifies the key works before saving. Or use free providers (Groq, Together, Hugging Face, Ollama) — no key needed for Ollama.

### Connect External Channels

Go to Settings > Bridges to connect Discord, Telegram, Slack, or WhatsApp. Enter your bot token, map channels, and toggle on.
